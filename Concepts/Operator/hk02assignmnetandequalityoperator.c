// in this question 
// The crux of the question lies in the statement x = y==z. The operator == is executed before = because precedence of comparison operators (<=, >= and ==) is higher than assignment operator =. The result of a comparison operator is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison result. Since y is equal to z, value of the expression y == z becomes 1 and the value is assigned to x via the assignment operator.
